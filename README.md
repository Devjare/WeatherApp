# Check the current local weather.

## FCC Description:

- Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.

### Rules:
1. Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
2. Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

### User Stories
1. I can see the weather in my current location.
2. I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
3. I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

**Note:** Many internet browsers now require an HTTP Secure (https://) connection to obtain a user's locale via HTML5 Geolocation. For this reason, we recommend using HTML5 Geolocation to get user location and then use the freeCodeCamp Weather API https://weather-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/ which uses an HTTP Secure connection for the weather. Also, be sure to connect to CodePen.io via https://.

When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the "I've completed this challenge" button.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the freeCodeCamp forum.
